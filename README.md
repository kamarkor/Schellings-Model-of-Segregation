# Schelling's Model of Segregation
In the 1970s, Thomas Schelling proposed a model that shows how an integrated city would likely turn into a segregated city under light assumptions. This model has become very popular in sociology and economics, observed segregation might be the emergent result of individuals interacting under social constraints in pursuit of certain preferences. Many studies have shown that the segregation studied by Schelling in small cities would also be present in large cities. The purpose behind this project is to apply Schelling's model to different population sizes in order to see and compare how segregation would evolve according to different parameters.
